# Prompts History

This file contains the history of all prompts used during the development of Brain Shelf.

## Prompts List

1. I need to develop a web application called "Brain Shelf" for centralized storage of useful project-related information. Main Goals: Collect instructions, settings, links, and notes from work chats into a structured and easily searchable storage. Requirements: (1) Support for multiple projects. (2) Convenient search, including: full-text search, filtering by descriptions, tags, and types, autocomplete. (3) Minimal manual input: if a link is submitted, automatically extract: page title, meta description, keywords, preview if possible. (4) Multilingual support: English and Russian. (5) Documentation: README with project description and run instructions, prompts.md file containing the history of all prompts - will be just only list with prompts as numeric list. (6) Technologies: Backend: latest .NET version, Database: PostgreSQL, Frontend: React + TypeScript, Docker. Repository: https://github.com/aliakseifilipovich/brain-shelf. What I need from you now: Create a development plan and cut it in GitHub Issues including: Number, Title, Description, Acceptance criteria, Component grouping and priorities. Each issue should represent a logically complete piece of work so that after it's done you can clearly see a concrete result. Create a .gitignore file and pull request with all this first files.

5. Please implement the issue 4 and create the new PR with implementation, check that everything works as expected before creating PR, if you will need to clarify something please ask me before proceed. Please add this promt to a history as previous. [User provided clarifications: Tag management - accept tag names and auto-create if they don't exist (case-insensitive), Entry content validation - Link type requires both URL and Content, Note/Setting/Instruction types require Content only (Url is optional), Tag filtering uses OR logic (entry must have ANY of the specified tags), Skip integration tests for now]
